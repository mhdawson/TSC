### nodejs/TSC

  * On agenda for visibility, nomination passes.

* Freeze releases and website changes, pending cache fixes? [1416](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1416)
  * Infrastructure on DO and Equinix for the website, docs and downloads
  * Over the past couple of years we have had increasing level of issues related to downloads
  * Usually ok when downloads are cached by Cloudflare, however, we invalidate the cache after every release or publish of the Website.  This causes lots of load to the base DO and Equinix servers. During these intervals we have slow downloads or inability to load downloads.
    * at this point we have issues being opened weekly
    * proposal is that in the short term
      * we stop invalidating for canary and nightly releases or temporarily stop them until we have a resolution.
      * Avoid publish of Website during core working hours for NA and Europe
    * Seems like we are at a point where it’s no longer sustainable to keep this going with
      volunteers at an availability level that people are expecting.
      * Suggestion is that we
        * ask OpenJS for resources to help
        * find a way to fund people to be available in a timely manner
        * set expectations in terms of SLA that downloads may be flaky.
    * Are thinking about ways to resolve the issues, but require `work` and existing volunteers
      don’t necessarily have time to work on the issues.
    * This is an ask for help
    * Michael – A few questions:
      * Anybody uncomfortable with cutting back on release?
        * _No objections_.
      * What is the reasonable SLA for downloads?
        * Tobias, downloads should be available at all times, believe we should be able to invalidate cache at more granular level
        * Claudio, until recently our Cloudflare account did not enable the granular access but we were recently upgraded.
    * Claudio - another solution being explored is moving downloads off of the main DO and Equinix servers.
    * Claudio – How does TSC feel about asking foundation for paid resources to manage downloads?
      * We agreed to:
        * Michael will send email to TSC to make sure there are no objections.
        * Rich will open issue in CPC repo with the request.

* Claudio - Website migration to Vercel [766](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/766) very close to switch over. Once have all build team members agreed it’s ready to go will ask for “ack” of no objections from TSC.

### nodejs/admin

* Transform the Website Team into a "Web Team" [#806](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/806)
  * Would have a set of subteams
    * node.js website
    * ux team
    * web infra - infrastructure that we have for the WebSite
    * web standards
