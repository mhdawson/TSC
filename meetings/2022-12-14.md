## Strategic Initiatives

### Startup performance (Joyee)

* There had been a gradual regression of startup performance starting from v15. v19 is about 40%+ slower than v14
* <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/45659> improved baseline startup by 17-18%
* <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/45716> improved baseline startup again by 17-18%, reversing the regression
* <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/45849> will improve baseline startup again by 10-11%, resulting in an overall 14-15% improvement compared to v14. Startup involving loading of all common builtin modules would still be 4-5% slower, because we simply have more internal modules and subnamespaces now.

### V8 (Michael Z)

* Updated to 10.9 a few weeks ago (will be stable in Jan) so ahead of the game
* Currently looking at canary which has a few failures

### Quic (James)

* Some code reviews, have not had a chance to look at them yet. But should have time coming up

### Shadow Realm (Chengzhong)

* No updates this week

### Next-10 (Michael)

* No update this week

### Security (Rafael)

* Rafael, about to open an issue about a check if the current version has a vulnerability.

### Single executable (Darshan)

* working on getting CI to run
  * Need some help. Michael volunteered to get together to help.
