### nodejs/node

* meta: move to emeritus automatically after 18 months [#41155](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/41155)
  * Closed, no discussion needed.

* Managing feature requests [#41113](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/41113)
  * Antoine, we don’t server people by leaving open, but what would be the threshold?
  * Michael, close after 6 months?
  * No objections from those to closing after 6 months.
  * Robert, add comment that says, please re-open if you feel strongly that it should be open.
  * Chalker, can irritate people, so need to be careful.
    * Try to proactively mark as “never stale”
  * Take discussion back to github
  * Michael will open PR to doc how we manage feature requests and we can have broader
    discussion in that PR.

* docs: Clarification around real world risks and use cases of VM module [#40718](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/40718)
  * Questions to TSC from issue
    * Do we want to mark the vm module with a "Do not use it to run untrusted code or for building systems that run untrusted code" statement? There are plenty of modules in the ecosystem that claims this.
      * Chalker believes we already did this a while back (<https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v17.x/docs/api/vm.html#vm-executing-javascript>)
    * Should we work to embed isolated-vm? Is that the solution we want?
      * There is comment in issue from maintainer of isolate-vm that says we don’t want to do that
* Rename default branch from "master" to "main" [#33864](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/33864)
  * No updates this week

* Migration of core modules to primordials [#30697](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/30697)
  * Some progress in defining the options -  <https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1104>
  * Rich, Anybody think we need to keep option C?
    * No we agreed to get rid of it.
  * Antoine. 2 votes
    * Do we want to make things tamper proof
    * If the answer to 1 is yes, then how?
  * Rich, the two may be intertwined. Ie if the method is too hard/complicated then it might be no,
    but if easy then yes.

  * We discussed narrowing the scope of the existing vote to just Module loading and policy
  * Bradley, used to all be in C++, would prefer it to be there.
    * Loaders WG, are talking about moving ES module loaders off thread, that would mean
      that it would have a good amount of protection, and you only need to guard the message
      Port.
    * Don’t believe commonJS is defensible, would break too much of the ecosystem
    * Rich will add comment to the issue, Bradley will correct comment if Rich gets is wrong.

### nodejs/TSC
