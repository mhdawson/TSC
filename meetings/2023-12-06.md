## Agenda

### Announcements

### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

* Michael - CPC discussion updates to the Travel fund, if you are interested please check out the issue or comment on updated proposal when it is published.

### nodejs/node

* lib: promote process.binding/_tickCallback to runtime deprecation [#50687](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/50687)
  * Discussed a few weeks ago, Joyee had suggested that we follow earlier suggestion for Anna in terms of doing it incrementally.
    * James had said in last meeting, he agrees it makes sense to defer a bit, still have some time to figure out if we should do it incrementally
    * Discussed if we should have a vote.
    * Joyee will open TSC issue to get gather info and with goal of turning that into a set of options for a vote.

* Seeking approval to use the Node.js logo on the WinterCG website [#50668](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/50668)
  * Agreed this can be dropped from agenda as no objections in issue and its moving forward and there is sufficient FYI to TSC.

### nodejs/TSC

* Update meeting times [#1469](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1469)
  * Unless there are objections in meeting lets move to the times suggested in <https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1469#issuecomment-1834589713> which are 15 and 16 UTC
  * No objections to the times 15 and 16 in TSC meeting today, will action.

### nodejs/admin

* Have a mascot [#828](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/828)
  * Agreed to remove from the agenda until there is a question for the TSC again

* Create `nodejs/socket` repository for Node.js implementation of Cloudflare's Socket API [#826](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/826)
  * Does this still need to be on agenda, seems like in short term consensus is not to pull it in. Probably does not need to be on agenda unless TSC members want to advocate for it.
  * Commented last week that it should be in WinterCG repo, or somewhere else.
  * For TSC, it starts by being published under namespace for individual/org until it is part of the standard
  * Some concern raised over taking over socket namespace at this point, better to wait until there are more signals.
  * Michael proposed we remove from agenda, add feedback to the issue that we believe consensus is that it’s too early to consider pulling it into the org. Please re-add to org if you would like to advocate otherwise.

* Events / Collaborator Summits for 2024 [#814](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/814)
  * Michael had sent email get see who was interested, discussion has mostly been about proposals from Matteo and Joyee.
  * Joyee just need to decide the when/where and how many people we are expecting
  * Proposed dates are April 3-4 in advance of CityJS London, plan to have 30-40 people and possibly break out room for 10-20.
  * No questions/concerns on that from TSC members in the meeting
  * Michael, also good to think about where we might have the second one, and if there is a conference in NA that it would make sense to collocate with.

## Strategic Initiatives

* Antoine - Core promise APIs, - no update, may not make sense to keep alive. Only Child process lacks a promise API.
  * Formal call for volunteers to propose API for child process
* Joyee - Startup Snapshot - PR to allow configuration, still needs more code reviews <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/50453>
* Michael - Next-10 - No update
