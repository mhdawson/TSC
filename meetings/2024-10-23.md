### nodejs/node

  * Looks like it is moving forward, no blocks, nothing to discuss this week.

* module,win: make module cache case-insensitive [#54478](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/54478)
  * Joyee will still have inconsistent results, also only commonJS
    * overall there are a number of issues and needs more work before it lands

    discussion at this point. Windows is configurable to allow case-sensitivity as well.
