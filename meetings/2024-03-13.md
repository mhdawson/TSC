## Agenda

### Announcements

* Matteo, collaborator summit is first week of April in London, if you are collaborator please
  reach out if you need any more info on how to join, see you there.

### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

* No updates this week.

### nodejs/node

  * we discussed later in the call as part of the corepack discussion.
* build: enable `yarn` and `pnpm` Corepack binaries by default
  * Ruy
    * Conversation is suffering because of not having a design doc, goals etc. Request in the PR
      is that we that we have more complete design, document, plans etc.
  * Geoffrey, agree with all of that, challenge is that there is a number of decisions that we have
    not made. Have opened a couple of PRs to put down a number of policies.
  * Michael, one thing to discuss is whether we have consensus if we need more design docs,
    plans, etc before landing the PR.
  * Matteo, something that might be easier might be question of if the project should work
    towards moving npm? That might be a simple fundamental question
    * Geoffrey PR to clarify that - <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/51951>
  * Ruy, there is also PR to remove corepack completely
  * Geoffrey let’s talk about the executable question
    * Intent is to clarify if Node.js will bundle binaries which are not vendored into the Node.js deps - <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/51994/files>
    * Michael, possibly it should be that Node.js will not enable external links, downloads
    * Antoine, if that PRs lands, would the PR just not update to say add corepack binaries
    * Matteo, guiding principle for what Node.js includes is not necessarily important, but what is
      important that you get reproducible builds.
      * Michael how does this affect discussion does Corepack affect reproducible builds
      * Matteo, corepack fixed issue I raised.
  * Michael, answer question on yarn or pnpm, past vote confirmed we would not include yarn
    and pnpm binaries.
  * Richard,
  * Geoffery, it saves command for yarn, pnpm, but adds burden to project.
  * Michael, key question in my mind is what level of responsibility/overhead we take by
    including a jumper? Threat model was updated to state we don’t take responsibility.
  * don’t believe that it will be effective in trying to wash our hands on it, will likely still
    get vulnerability reports, asks for fixes etc.
  * Ruy, pnpm has been very passive in the discussion, most value to yarn, which is why I
    believe the plans, technical rationale is important.
    * Geoffrey pnpm wants to stay out of it because it’s become heated
  * Matteo, take is that it does not matter,
  * Antoine, Myles suggested we should discuss if Corepack can land it Node.js 22

* Possible questions to clarify
  * There is no intention to remove npm - <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/51951> (no objections from 13 TSC members in call)
  * Will Node.js install links that enable binaries, scripts, etc. outside of Node.js -
    <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/51994>
  * Should the existing PR be blocked on the asks for more design, plans, discussion

[#51886](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/51886)
