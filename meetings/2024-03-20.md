  they are elected at the same time. Matteo that means my term is over and there will be an
  Election. Plan to run again.

### nodejs/node

* doc: add policy for “placeholder” executables [#52107](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/52107)
  * covered under discussion for - Corepack
    decisions [#1518](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1518)

* deps: remove corepack [#51981](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/51981)

* build: enable `yarn` and `pnpm` Corepack binaries by default #51886
  * deferred discussion to focus on - Corepack decisions [#1518](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1518)

### nodejs/nodejs.org

* Redesign suggests all versions of Node.js include corepack [#6441](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/issues/6441)

* globally installing npm should not be the recommended way for Mac and Linux [#6361](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/issues/6361)
  * Matteo opened this - goes back in history, if you install in Mac, and Linux because it requires
    sudo. If you use nvm to manage versions, it does not work very well.
  * Geoffrey, package maintenance team is starting to discuss this approach, should this be
    kicked over to that team ? Matteo, website is the issue in terms of what it recommends.
  * Michael, clarify do you mean npm or node globally. Matteo, both.
  * Myles, past discussion of creating a new/better installer which stalled out. Existing installers
    are a challenge.
  * Michael, sounds like we should kick over to the package maintenance team
  * Matteo we should do something in the short term and in the long term
    * Should really not be following recommendations for Mac,
  * Paolo other ways to install like brew as well, challenge is that we don’t manage many of the
    tools which is a complication in recommending. Ask npm if they can change paths used for
    global models
  * Michael will transfer issue to package-maint team

### nodejs/TSC

* Corepack decisions [#1518](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1518)
  * discussed and agreed that next step is to focus on -
    <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/52107>, we will reserve most of next week’s meeting to
    discuss. People please start discussion in the next week so we have as much basis as
    possible to start the discussion.

  * open PR for switch Michael will close

* fix: remove npm [#418](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack/pull/418)
  * deferred discussion to focus on - Corepack decisions [#1518](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1518)

* Questions we agreed last week to try to move forward
  * There is no intention to remove npm - <https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/51951> (no objections from 13 TSC members in call)
    * PR landed to document that there is no intension to remove npm

  * Will Node.js install links that enable binaries, scripts, etc. outside of Node.js -

    * More discussion this week - as part of  - Corepack
      decisions [#1518](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1518)
