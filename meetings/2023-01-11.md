* CPC updates
  * No updates

* Board Meeting
  * No updates

### nodejs/node

* doc: add experimental stages [#46100](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/46100)
  * believed we had consensus last week, but blocks once opened
  * blocks removed though, and 4 approvals now
  * Remaining question
    * Land now before updating the rest of the docs?
      * Could take a while to update all of the docs if we wait
    * Might be confusing if we don’t wait
  * Tobias, we discussed experimental/security, does this PR change any of that?
  * Tobias one big PR or multiple PRs?
    * Geoffrey one per subsystem
    * Beth, for backporting keeping per subsystem makes it slightly easier
  * Candidate plan
    * Land but mark as “don’t backport” for now
    * Work to get PRs for 2-3 subsystems, will help validate and then we can backport those
      along with the initial one.

* events,bootstrap: make globalThis extend EventTarget [#45993](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/45993)
  * Michael: We discussed this last week and left a comment on the issue. There is some
    discussion in the issue but nothing that I think changes the discussion for the TSC. I think
    we can remove it from the agenda for now.

* Expose Undici's ProxyAgent and setGlobalDispatcher within Node [#43187](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/43187)
  * Decided to wait until next meeting when Matteo is here.
