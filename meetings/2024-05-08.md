  * Matteo, recommend is that it be reverted
  * Paolo, why did we make the change
  * Richard, because it’s not just collaborators who can request CI, triagers can as well

* Allowing using `request-ci` label for  collaborators in unapproved PRs [#801](https://github.com/nodejs/node-core-utils/issues/801)
  * This addresses the same issue as #805 above

## Robin - new funding opportunity

* new funding opportunity, private/public funding
* modeled on STF, needs to be very specific on what we are proposing and what we are
  delivering.
* will only support 4 projects globally, 400k for 24 months
* Need to cover both technical program and social program
* Deadline is next Friday
* Michael, mentioned effort around testing
* Gireesh, mentioned proposing end user support (through help)
* Matteo, season of docs was mentioned, something similar could be set up for undici, could be a lot of work around docs, to help build on what Claudio is working on
* Matteo, could we use the $ to run a few code-and-learn events
  * Robin, interest at grace hopper
  * Michael, next-10 focus on growing and retaining collaborators which fits that as well
* Matteo, need to improve diversity
  * good way to do that is to use part of the funds for that
  * not sure how
