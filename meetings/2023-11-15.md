## Agenda

### Announcements

* No announcements this week

### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

* No cpc updates

### nodejs/node

* lib: promote process.binding/_tickCallback to runtime deprecation [#50687](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/50687)
  * James - PR to deprecate, over a number of majors, using command line method as
    intermediate step
  * Joyee - would prefer we limit breakage by only deprecating things that are are holding us
    back and are dangerous versus harmless
  * fair amount of discussion/back forth.

* \[v18.x\] Backport most ESM and customization hook changes [#50669](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/50669)
  * On agenda to get more people to comment
  * Michael Z - Some time pressure, next V18 release is late to fix recent regressions
  * James, how about a deadline of next Tuesday for people to object
  * Michael we should give an FYI to the APM people active in Node.js

* doc: move deprecated utils to runtime deprecation [#50488](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/50488)
  * James, similar to process.binding, it's a handful of APIs that have been sitting on util,
    there are alternatives already
  * Michael, discussion in the issue is around whether we would actually deprecate or not.
  * Joyee in the past we had deprecated if not in a module (ie top level), this would make it
    much less noisy.
  * Tobias, in these cases they are not harmful, versus buffer constructor which we felt was
    Dangerous.
  * Geoffrey, question of whether they still cover newer JavaScript and therefore don’t
    necessarily work properly
  * Joyee, what do we gain by annoying people who use 3rd party modules
  * Geoffrey from that perspective we’ll never remove anything
  * Joyee, warning for just those who use, versus people using modules
  * Michael Z, doubt that anybody would see the warnings in that case
  * We deprecated punny code, warning were emitted, and there were no real complaints
  * Yagiz, what is holding back runtime deprecation
  * Tobias, the question is any potential breakage worth the little value we get
  * James, tradeoff is break people or make things better for ourselves
  * Joyee maybe we want to do
    * start with deprecation only from direct users
    * deprecation as in PR
  * Michael Z, Joyee are you proposing this as an update to our regular process
  * James, overtime we seem to just kick the can down the road, our current deprecation policy
    is not work, we need to agree on approach versus debating every time
  * James, those people who are opposed, come up with alternate proposal

* test: set test-fs-watch as flaky [#50250](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/50250)
  * Closed no discussion needed.

* deps,doc,lib,src,test: add experimental web storage
[#50169](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/50169)

* The env var `NODE_V8_COVERAGE` intermittently causes the process to hang [#49344](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/49344)

* Support for file-system based persistent code cache in user-land module loaders [#47472](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/47472)
  * ask is to please look at and comment if you have security concerns
