### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

* No update this week.

### nodejs/node

* doc: state that removing npm is a non-goal [#51951](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/51951)
  * Ask was that we defer in depth discussion to next meeting

* build: enable `yarn` and `pnpm` Corepack binaries by default [#51886](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/51886)
  * Ask was that we defer in depth discussion to next meeting
  * Corepack is version manager, integrated with Node.js for a few years
    * PR to enable by default, if you have objections etc. read the context
      add your objections
    * Currently corepack requires a command line option to enable it, when
      It is enabled, symlinks are added for pnpm and yarn, when you hit
      those symlinks it downloads a version and runs it for you.
    * PR removes the step of disabling.  Instead the symlinks would be there
      by default
    * Some objections
      * Don’t have enough doc, which package managers would we support, how do we decide which ones to add. Etc.
      * Don’t have agreement on goals, etc.
      * Some objections on ux perspective that npm is not supported, and npm does not support
        package.json that corepack uses.
      * Some discussion around devengines field that npm would be willing to implement which
        could be supported in both corepack and npm
        * some would like to wait until discussion work on devengines to complete before we move
          forward
      * objections concerns about jumper binary approach, one of the reasons why npm has opted
      * npm opted to not be included in corepack since the beginning
      * alternate proposal, could add script that downloads corepack and then yarn, versus
        bundling corepack
      * Rafael, next step
        * Antoine if you have objections, put them into the issue, we will discuss in meeting next
          week
        * narrow down the goal of corepack

* Expose Undici's ProxyAgent and setGlobalDispatcher within Node [#43187](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/43187)
  * Proposal to discuss in the collaborator summit
