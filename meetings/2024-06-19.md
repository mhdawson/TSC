### Reminders

### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

* No updates this week

### nodejs/node

* doc: deprecate NaN or negative number as delay to setTimeout and setInterval [#53005](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/53005)
  * Legendecas, current discussion is what warnings we might generate, or should we deviate
    from the browser behavior.
  * Concern might be that deprecation warnings might suggest we are going to deviate
  * Suggestion is to make it a non-deprecation warning.
  * Michael see there are a number of TSC approvers and blockers but non of them are in the
    meeting so let's leave on the agenda until the next meeting.

### nodejs/TSC

* Open OpenCollective and Github Sponsors for Node.js [#1553](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1553)
  * On agenda for awareness, no specific question at this point - <https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1553>

* Coordinating nodejs security audit report finalization and publication
[#1546](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1546)
  * Rafael, no update still don’t have the report.
  * Lets remove from agenda and we will add on once we get it.

* New Strategic Initiative on Primordials [#1439](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1439)
  * leave on agenda until next time since Benjamin who tagged for agenda is not.

### nodejs/admin

* Non-violent communication / strategic workplace conflict resolution training for the TSC and moderation team [#877](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/877)
  * Of the 8 TSC members in the meeting there were no concerns/objections to asking the OpenJS foundation for $ to do that.

* Better process for communicating feedback to members by the TSC [#876](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/876)
  * leave on agenda until next time since Benjamin who tagged for agenda is not present.

* Creation of an official Discord server for the Node.js project [#872](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/872)
  * Michael: any concerns from those here?
  * Richard: main ones are what does it mean to be “official” and what the relationship would be.
  * Tobias: Claudio partially answered that question. Main benefit or marking it as “official” is that
    people looking for it will be more comfortable they found the right one, and possibly some
    perks from discord.
  * Tobias: seems like agreement is that we are not happy with moderation etc. Could we make it
    unofficial again without impacting the server.

### nodejs/next-10

* Next 10 - Funding Deep Dive [#273](https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/issues/273)
  * Planning to reschedule
  * Michael main thing is if there is interest and we should reschedule again
  * There were a few interested people who said the time did not work for them.

## Strategic Initiatives

* Shadow Realm: Legendecas, update in last week TC39 meeting - ShadowRealm FYI Update, Will follow up with suggestion of what APIs should be exposed in Node.js
* V8 - Michael Z - nothing to talk about. Trying to keep canary in good shape, have not had
  time to update the main branch. Don’t believe it will be possible to update again in 22.x as
  There has been a lot of breaking changes in the public API
  * Joyee, V8 announced they will remove support for msvc and move to clang for future
    versions in Windows. Question is if we can make it for September? Stefan is working
    it.
  * Richard, V8 for windows has always been clang based on msvc was really just “tolerated”.
    One big question is what it means for addons. Really just a 23.x and later issue.
  * Chengzhong, heads up that MacOS debug build been broken since last v8 update -
    <https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/53446>. Michael Z, bit of a surprise as I always build
    with debug enabled.  Chengzhong/Michael we get together to figure out.
    * Rafael mentioned he had some issues and will share how he fixed it.
  * Next 10 - PR to share survey results is open
  * Snapshot: they are reproducible again on  linux at least in the same container, going to see if
    it can be backported to older releases.
