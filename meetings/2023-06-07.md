## Agenda

### Announcements

* Rafael - Node.js 20.3 should be released tomorrow

### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

* No updates.

### nodejs/node-gyp

* DISCUSSION: Release handling [#2860](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/2860)
  * Michael gave a quick overview of the issue
  * Rafael, one idea might be to ask Foundation to fund rewriting in Node.js
  * Need to ask more broadly if we have any collaborators that have skills/would be interested in getting involved.

### nodejs/node

* module: make CJS load from ESM loader [#47999](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/47999)
  * Added to agenda for visibility, not much to discuss
  * Related Geoffrey, Qard added for more guidance on handling breaking changes on experimental features - <https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1397>

### nodejs/TSC

* CLI tools behind a Nodejs namespace [#1178](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1178)
  * leave on agenda until we have Daniele to confirm we have covered
  * ok to start migrating packages to the node-core namespace.
  * we need to give TSC members access to npm for deprecating old packages
  * Rafael will add comment on 1178 that covers how it was handled with fastify.
    * <https://github.com/fastify/deprecate-modules>
    * Workflow assuming package is currently on version v2.x:
      * Release a new major with npm deprecate pointing to the new module and no content, so version v3.0.0
      * Create a new package with the correct name: @node-core/module in the version v4.0.0

### nodejs/admin

* Archive nodejs/help in favour of a Help Section on Discussions [#802](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/802)
  * Lets defer until a future meeting where ideally we have Gireesh

## Strategic Initiatives

* Yagiz - Recent changes from the performance initiative:
  * I opened a back-port for Ada v2.5 to LTS (which comes with performance improvements)
  * Khafra started writing mimesniff which will be included in the next release of Ada. <https://github.com/ada-url/mimesniff>
  * Vin√≠cius opened a pull request for improving the performance of legacy main resolve in module resolution: src,lib: reducing C++ calls of esm legacy main resolve node#48325
  * I opened a pull request for adding NDEBUG=1 to clang flags. Feedback is appreciated. build: add -DNDEBUG=1 to clang flags node#48271
  * Libuv 1.45.0 - significantly faster filesystem ops got merged into Node.js and will be included in the next release
  * Khavil did some amazing work on improving & reducing the compilation time of Node.js
  * I started focusing on ESM loader performance. Currently reducing the URL invocations.
