## Agenda

### Announcements

* Matteo - thinking of doing collab summit in April before CityJS, still not looked in but working on it, so good to pencil it into your calendar.
* Matteo, if there is a good event in NA for a collab summit please let us know.

### CPC and Board Meeting Updates

*Extracted from **tsc-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/node

* Inconsistent behavior of nextTick and queueMicrotask [#51156](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/51156)
  * Matteo
    * today we say when you emit errors, you should do it in NextTick so that people can register event handlers to catch them.
    * Unfortunately this does not play well with promises.  Tried out a fix, but broke many tests
      * Fix was to invert the position of the two microtasks/nextTick
  * Robert, problem is that we have a bug that causes a lot of subtle behaviors, depends on whether you are calling from SetImmediate or microtask context it you can get different behavior.
    * Only way to fix it is to break a lot of code
  * Benjamin, these kinds of timing bugs are really tricky to fix. Not convinced the fix actually works, just moves the problem to somewhere else. We should make sure that all of our APIs emit in the right place
  * Matteo will post the diff
  * Tagged for visibility
  * Michael, is this unspecified or is there some reason to depend on ordering
  * Robert, unspecified, but too easy to shoot yourself in the foot

* enable corepack by default [#50963](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/50963)
  * Original question was if we can make its use easier
  * Clear that npm does not want to be distributed through corepack
  * Antoine: gave an overview
  * Call is for people to comment on the issue

* lib: promote process.binding/_tickCallback to runtime deprecation [#50687](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/50687)
  * <https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1482> was opened to discuss plan, please jump in there to and comment/discuss
  * Joyee please review/comment in the issue

### nodejs/admin
