### nodejs/next-10

* Metadata Proposal for Docs [#166](https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/issues/166)
  * Claudio took us through the proposal and a they key aspects
  * Matteo commented that if goal is to be able to translate, translations are hard to keep up to date and it generally does not work. Might want to do it for a small subset of languages
    * Claudio indicated that it is not a primary goal, but a side effect that can also be leveraged
  * Matteo, having to edit multiple files makes things harder versus easier, if we can keep to one file that is better.
  * Tobias mentioned he has made similar comments in the issue for the proposal. Why not use TypeScript instead of YAML for argument types etc. if one of the main goals is to better support derivation of types?
  * Richard: backporting/release process is being discussed in the issue
  * Feedback summary: <https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/issues/166#issuecomment-1431681717>
