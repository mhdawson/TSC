* Issues with newer V8 versions [#42375](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/42375)
  * Targos: quite difficult to have green CI with recent V8 versions mostly due to Windows, but
    only if we update to Chrome Canary. This version will not be stable by the time we release
    v18. Won’t even be beta.  
  * Michael when will it be release, Targos May 24
  * Targos, 2 other alternatives
    * stop supporting windows 32 bit versions
      * could do that temporarily
    * stick with current version which is already a few months old
  * Beth: could we remove Windows 32 bit support with aim of adding it back later on
  * Targos: In terms of coverage until April 28th only in chrome Canary
  * Ronag: not sure how risky canary is
  * Antoine: use it but don’t see issues
  * Richard, canary on main, use V8 version that will go stable 1 week after release (10.1 of V8)
    without 32 bit support for short, and update to 10.2 as soon as possible.
  * Targos will document in issue related to dropping 32 bit support and ping TSC.
